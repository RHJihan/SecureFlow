# Spring Boot User Management System - Issue Resolution Summary

## Issue Identified
The Spring Boot application was running successfully but **login and registration were not working** due to a **database schema compatibility issue**.

## Root Cause
The problem was with PostgreSQL table name case sensitivity:
- Database schema used quoted table names: `"user"` and `"role"`
- JPA/Hibernate entities were mapped to unquoted table names: `user` and `role`
- PostgreSQL treats quoted identifiers as case-sensitive, causing SQL errors

**Error Details:**
```sql
ERROR: column u1_0.id does not exist
SQL: select u1_0.id,u1_0.created_at,u1_0.email,u1_0.enabled,u1_0.first_name,u1_0.last_name,u1_0.password,u1_0.updated_at,u1_0.username from user u1_0 where u1_0.username=? and u1_0.enabled=true
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Database Schema
- **Updated table names** from quoted `"user"`, `"role"` to unquoted `users`, `roles`
- **Updated JPA entity mappings** to match new table names:
  - `@Table(name = "user")` → `@Table(name = "users")`
  - `@Table(name = "role")` → `@Table(name = "roles")`

### 2. Database Recreation
- Created new schema file: `sql-scripts/fixed-postgresql-schema.sql`
- Applied fixed schema to PostgreSQL database
- Maintained all sample data and relationships

### 3. Verification Testing

#### ✅ Login Functionality
- **Admin login**: `admin/password123` - SUCCESS
- **Manager login**: `manager/password123` - SUCCESS  
- **Employee login**: `employee/password123` - SUCCESS
- **Invalid credentials**: Correctly rejected

#### ✅ Registration Functionality
- **New user registration**: SUCCESS
- **Duplicate username/email**: Correctly rejected
- **Login with newly registered user**: SUCCESS
- **Database persistence**: User correctly saved

## Application Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL ✅

### Available Features
1. **User Authentication** - Login/Logout working
2. **User Registration** - New user creation working
3. **Role-Based Security** - Different access levels configured
4. **Database Integration** - PostgreSQL connection working
5. **CSRF Protection** - Security tokens working

### Test Credentials
- **Admin**: `admin/password123` (All access)
- **Manager**: `manager/password123` (Employee + Manager access)
- **Employee**: `employee/password123` (Employee access only)

### Available Endpoints
- `/` - Home page (requires EMPLOYEE role)
- `/login` - Login page
- `/register/showRegistrationForm` - Registration form
- `/leaders` - Leadership page (requires MANAGER role)
- `/systems` - Systems page (requires ADMIN role)
- `/logout` - Logout

## Files Modified
1. `src/main/java/com/jihan/springboot/usermanagement/entity/User.java`
2. `src/main/java/com/jihan/springboot/usermanagement/entity/Role.java`
3. `sql-scripts/fixed-postgresql-schema.sql` (new)

## Key Lessons
1. **PostgreSQL Case Sensitivity**: Quoted identifiers are case-sensitive
2. **JPA Entity Mapping**: Table names must match exactly between entity and database
3. **Testing Importance**: Comprehensive testing revealed the actual issue
4. **Database Validation**: Always verify DDL-auto mode matches entity expectations

## Next Steps for Production
1. Update connection pool settings for production load
2. Implement password complexity requirements
3. Add user account lockout after failed attempts  
4. Configure proper logging levels
5. Set up database monitoring

The application is now **fully functional** with both login and registration working correctly!
